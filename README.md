# Epam-cafe

## Description
The client places an order for lunch (chooses from the menu) and indicates the time when
he would like to receive the order. The system shows the price of the order and offers to pay from the client's account
or in cash upon receipt of the order. Loyalty points are awarded to the customer for pre-orders. If the Client places
an order and does not pick it up, then loyalty points are taken off until blocking. The client can rate each Order
and leave feedback. The administrator manages the menu, sets / removes bans / bonuses / points for Clients.
